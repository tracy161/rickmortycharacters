## Completed Tasks

Please find below the completed tasks (both minimum and advanced requirements)

### Minimum requirements

Create the following pages:

- Characters
  - List characters and display their name and image
  - Allowing searching for characters based on their name
  - Link each character to their details page
- Character Details
  - Display all of the characters information
  - List the episodes that the character appears in

### Advanced

- Add pagination to the Characters page
- Allowing filtering of characters based on gender, species, status, and type (type has countless options to filters for all characters so I did not do filter for type)
- Write a unit test for one of your presentational components (2 unit tests)
  + Unit Test for Navbar Router Component
  + Unit Test for Character Details Component to check if the Details page component is rendered or not
